# onion-universe

This is my code repository for anything related to the finite coasting cosmology, also known (by me ;^D) as "the onion universe". Strictly speaking, such alias is most appropriate for the $R(t) = ct$ case ($\Omega_k = -1$), but this is (once again, in my opinion) the only model that makes sense close to the Big Bang, and I hope I can eventaually recover it as $t \to 0$. In the meantime, I guess I can live with any other value of the curvature density, as long as it is negative, and there is no repulsive cosmological constant ;^D

Have fun,

Yago
